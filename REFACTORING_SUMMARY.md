# Kindle Highlights Extractor - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `kindle_highlights.py` file has been refactored to improve code organization, readability, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Organized Imports**
- Grouped imports into standard library, third-party, and local imports
- Added clear section comments for better organization

### 2. **Constants and Configuration**
- Extracted magic numbers and strings into named constants
- Centralized CSS selectors for easier maintenance
- Defined Chrome options and paths as constants
- Added timeout and delay constants for better configuration

### 3. **Method Decomposition**
- Broke down large methods into smaller, focused private methods
- Each method now has a single responsibility
- Improved readability and testability

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better separation of concerns in error handling
- More specific exception handling
- Cleaner error messages

### 5. **Enhanced Code Structure**

#### Driver Setup (`setup_driver`)
- Split into `_create_chrome_options()`, `_setup_macos_chrome_path()`, `_initialize_driver()`, and `_configure_driver()`
- Each method handles a specific aspect of driver setup

#### Login Process (`wait_for_login`)
- Separated into `_show_login_instructions()` and `_poll_for_login()`
- Added `_is_on_notebook_page()` helper method

#### Book Extraction (`get_available_books`)
- Broke down into multiple helper methods:
  - `_extract_book_data()` - Main extraction logic
  - `_extract_book_title()` - Title extraction
  - `_extract_book_author()` - Author extraction
  - `_extract_book_image()` - Image URL extraction
  - `_extract_book_date()` - Date extraction

#### Highlight Extraction (`extract_highlights_from_book`)
- Split into multiple focused methods:
  - `_validate_extraction_prerequisites()` - Validation
  - `_extract_highlights_from_page()` - Page-level extraction
  - `_extract_highlight_data()` - Individual highlight extraction
  - `_extract_highlight_text()`, `_extract_highlight_color()`, etc. - Specific field extraction

#### File Saving
- Created shared helper methods:
  - `_prepare_save_path()` - Path preparation
  - `_sanitize_filename()` - Filename sanitization
  - `_write_markdown_file()` and `_write_json_file()` - File writing
  - `_convert_highlights_to_dict()` - Data conversion

#### Main Execution (`run`)
- Broke down into logical steps:
  - `_show_welcome_message()` - UI display
  - `_setup_and_launch()` - Initialization
  - `_handle_login()` - Login process
  - `_process_books()` - Book processing
  - `_extract_and_save_highlights()` - Highlight extraction
  - `_cleanup()` - Resource cleanup

### 6. **Type Hints and Documentation**
- Added comprehensive type hints throughout
- Improved docstrings for all methods
- Better parameter and return type documentation

### 7. **Code Reusability**
- Shared helper methods for common operations
- Reduced code duplication
- Consistent patterns across similar operations

### 8. **Maintainability Improvements**
- Easier to modify individual components
- Better separation of concerns
- More modular structure
- Constants make configuration changes easier

## Benefits

1. **Readability**: Code is now easier to read and understand
2. **Maintainability**: Changes can be made to specific components without affecting others
3. **Testability**: Smaller methods are easier to unit test
4. **Reusability**: Helper methods can be reused across different parts of the code
5. **Configuration**: Constants make it easy to adjust timeouts, selectors, and other settings
6. **Error Handling**: Better error handling with more specific error messages

## File Structure

The refactored code maintains the same external interface while providing a much cleaner internal structure. All existing functionality is preserved, but the code is now more organized and maintainable.
